Triplify installation is easy:

1. Place the contents of this folder containing the Triplify script and
   a configuration file into your Web application directory on your Web server.
   Make the cache directory writable for your Web server, i.e. by issuing:
   chmod a+w cache
   Note: At the moment, this folder needs to be named exactly triplify!

2. Copy the distributed Triplify configuration config.dist.php to config.inc.php.

3. Open config.inc.php in a text editor and follow
   the instructions. You will create and add here a number of SQL queries,
   selecting information, which should be made publicly available.
   Before creating a new configuration check whether a configuration for your
   Web application is already available at: http://triplify.org/Documentation

4. Congratulations! Your Web application is now part of the Semantic Web,
   interoperable  and mashable with other Web applications. Simply, access
   http://yourWebApp.com/triplify/ in your Web browser to see if Triplify works
   correctly. When accessed first time Triplify will register your Triplify
   data source at: http://triplify.org/Registry
